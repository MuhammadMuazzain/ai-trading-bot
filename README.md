Freqtrade is a free trading bot written in Python. It is designed to support all major exchanges and be controlled via Telegram or webUI. It contains backtesting, plotting and money management tools as well as strategy optimization by machine learning.
## Disclaimer

Always start by running a trading bot in Dry-run and do not engage money
before you understand how it works and what profit/loss you should
expect.

I strongly recommend you to have coding and Python knowledge. Do not
hesitate to read the source code and understand the mechanism of this bot.

## Development branches

The project is currently setup in two main branches:

- `develop` - This branch has often new features, but might also contain breaking changes. We try hard to keep this branch as stable as possible.
- `stable` - This branch contains the latest stable release. This branch is generally well tested.
- `feat/*` - These are feature branches, which are being worked on heavily. Please don't use these unless you want to test a specific feature.
